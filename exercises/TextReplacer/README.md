# Text Replacer

Create a program to replace words in a text file, saving the result into a new file.

The file, the word to search and word to replace it with must be given as parameters. For example:

````java
replace("file.txt", "hello", "goodbye");
````

The new file file would be named "file.txt.out" and contain all the appearances of "hello" replaced by "goodbye".
