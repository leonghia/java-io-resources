# Counter Letter in File

Create a program to count the amount of times that a certain character is inside a file (of any kind).

The file and the letter can be asked to the user or passed as parameters. For example:

````java
count("example.txt", "a");
````

It must display on the screen the amount of letters found. You can choose anyway to interact with the user, e.g. showing proper help.
